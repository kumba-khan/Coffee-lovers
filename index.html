        Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted, ground coffee beans. 
        Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, it has a stimulating effect 
        on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decaffeinated coffee is also commercially available, and there are 
        various coffee substitutes for those who prefer alternatives.

      <h1>History of Coffee ☕</h1>
      <p>
        The history of coffee dates back centuries, first from its origin in 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> and 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen">Yemen</a>. 
        It was already known in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca">Mecca</a> in the 15th century. 
        In the same period, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zawiya_(institution)">Sufi Muslim monasteries</a> 
        in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coffee later spread to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant">Levant</a> in the early 16th century, 
        reaching <strong>Italy</strong> through Mediterranean trade routes. 
        By the mid-17th century, it had reached <strong>India</strong> and the <strong>East Indies</strong>. 
        Coffee houses soon became popular in Holland, England, and Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the New World, Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. 
        These beans sprouted into thousands of trees, enabling its spread to the Caribbean, Mexico, and beyond. 
        By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half of the world’s coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 1852, <strong>Brazil</strong> became the world’s largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. 
        From 1950 onward, other major producers emerged—Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. 
        By 1999, Vietnam had overtaken Colombia as the second-largest producer. 
        Today, coffee is one of the world’s most popular beverages, with immense cultural and economic impact.
